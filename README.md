# Frontend App for CapRover

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

Run CapRover backend service in debug mode. Change `.env.development` to match your backend. Then run `npm start`

We strive to keep CapRover code base consistent. This will ensure a high level of consistency and lower maintenance load.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Theming

CaprRover's fronted supports dark and light modes. It is based on `antd` colour schemes. Therefore, all used `antd` components within the project support both modes by default. However if we implement a custom component or want to change some global colors some steps needs to be considered.

### Implement Dark Mode in custom component

To ensure your elements work with both dark and light modes, following points needs to be considered:

-   **Don't use JSX inline styles for colors, use classNames instead and generate according rules within the `app.less`**
-   Use `antd` variables as `@layout-body-background, @body-background, @skeleton-color` for the colors.
    -   Use `@layout-body-background` for page backgrounds [`#f0f2f5`, `#000`]
    -   Use `@background-color-light` for log views or input areas [`#fafafa`, `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.04)`]
    -   Use `@body-background` for elements within a card [`#fff`, `#000`]
    -   Use `@skeleton-color` for all border colors. [`#f2f2f2`, `#303030`]
-   Use the class `.inner-card` for nested cards, like the network stats.
-   If you need additional colors, that are present within an `antd` component, grab the according variable located in `~antd/lib/style/themes/default.less`

#### Dev Mode & Hot Reload

It can happen that modifying the `app.less` during `npm run dev` leads to `FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory less`. To overcome this, we need to set `max-old-space-size`.

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"
```

### Global Variables

To add global less variables place them in `styles/vars.less`.

### Override Antd specific Variables

To override `antd` specific colors modify the according constant in `config-overrides.js` -> [`lightVars`, `darkVars`].
